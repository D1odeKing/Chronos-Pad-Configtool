- **Human Role**: D10D3K1NG provided:
  - Project requirements and specifications
  - Feature requests and design feedback
  - Bug detection and quality assurance
  - Testing and validation
  - Hardware integration requirements
  - User experience direction

### Code Ownership

The source code in this repository represents a collaboration between:
- **AI Code Generation**: GitHub Copilot (OpenAI/Microsoft)
- **Project Direction**: D10D3K1NG
- **Testing & Validation**: D10D3K1NG

### Licensing

This project is released under the MIT License (see [LICENSE](../LICENSE) file).

### Development Methodology

1. **Requirements Phase**: Human specifies desired features and functionality
2. **Implementation Phase**: AI generates code following best practices
3. **Testing Phase**: Human tests functionality and identifies bugs
4. **Refinement Phase**: AI fixes bugs based on human feedback
5. **Documentation Phase**: AI creates comprehensive documentation
6. **Iteration**: Process repeats for each feature

This collaborative approach combines AI's code generation capabilities with human domain expertise and quality control.
