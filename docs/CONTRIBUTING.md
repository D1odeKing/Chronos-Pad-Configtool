## 🤖 About This AI-Generated Project

This project's codebase is primarily written by **GitHub Copilot AI** with direction and validation from **David (D1odeKing)**. Understanding this collaborative model is essential for contributing effectively.

### Your Role as a Contributor

When contributing to this project, you play the **Human** role:

1. **Define Requirements**: Specify WHAT you want to add/fix
2. **Test & Validate**: Run code and identify issues
3. **Provide Feedback**: Report bugs, suggest improvements
4. **Review Changes**: Validate that AI-generated code meets requirements

You do **NOT** need to write the code yourself - let AI do that! Instead, focus on:
- Clear problem descriptions
- Thorough testing
- Quality feedback
- Feature requirements

## 🎯 How to Contribute

### 1. Using GitHub Copilot (Recommended)

If you have GitHub Copilot access:

1. **Fork & Clone** the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Chronos-Pad-Configtool.git
   cd Chronos-Pad-Configtool
   ```

2. **Create a branch** for your feature
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Describe your feature** in comments
   ```python
   # I need a function that validates encoder configuration
   # It should check:
   # - Rotation action is valid (cycle_layers, volume, brightness, etc.)
   # - Button action is valid (reset, toggle, mute, etc.)
   # - Divisor is between 1 and 10
   # - Returns True if valid, False otherwise with error message
   
   # Let Copilot generate the function...
   ```

4. **Let AI generate the code** - Copilot will suggest implementation

5. **Test thoroughly** - Run the code and validate functionality
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

6. **Commit with AI attribution**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: Add encoder validation function

   AI-generated validation logic for encoder configuration.
   - Validates rotation actions
   - Validates button actions  
   - Checks divisor range
   - Returns clear error messages

   Tested by: Your Name"
   ```

7. **Push and create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### 2. Without GitHub Copilot (Manual)

If you don't have Copilot:

1. **Describe the issue/feature** clearly in a GitHub Issue
   - What problem are you solving?
   - What behavior do you expect?
   - What have you tried?
   - Include error messages and screenshots

2. **David or another Copilot user** will generate the code

3. **Test the solution** when implemented

4. **Provide feedback** on whether it works

## 📋 Code Standards

### Documentation Requirements

**Every function must have**:
```python
def my_function(param1: str, param2: int) -> bool:
    """
    Brief one-line summary.
    
    Detailed explanation of what this function does and why.
    Explain the purpose and context within the application.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of first parameter
        param2: Description of second parameter
    
    Returns:
        Description of return value
    
    Example:
        >>> result = my_function("test", 42)
        >>> print(result)
        True
    
    Note:
        Generated by GitHub Copilot AI
        Tested by: Your Name
    """
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `CollapsibleCard`)
- **Functions/Methods**: `snake_case` (e.g., `generate_code_py`)
- **Constants**: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `FIXED_ROW_PINS`)
- **Private methods**: `_leading_underscore` (e.g., `_apply_theme`)

### Type Hints

Always use type hints:
```python
def process_keymap(
    keymap_data: list[list[list[str]]], 
    layer_index: int
) -> dict[str, any]:
    """Process keymap data for given layer."""
    pass
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Before Submitting PR

1. **Manual Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test the application
   python main.py
   
   # Try all related features
   # - Does the new feature work?
   # - Did you break anything else?
   # - Are there any errors in console?
   ```

2. **Code Generation Test** (if applicable)
   ```bash
   # Test code generation
   python scripts/preview_gen.py > test_output.txt
   
   # Review generated code
   # - Is it valid Python?
   # - Does it include your changes?
   # - Are there any syntax errors?
   ```

3. **Multiple Configurations**
   - Test with different themes (Dark, Light, Cheerful)
   - Test with extensions enabled/disabled
   - Test with multiple layers
   - Test with saved configurations

### Reporting Test Results
